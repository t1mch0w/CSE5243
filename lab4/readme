Project 4
Name: Fang Zhou

1. Structure of the project
Root
|-jaccard.py	Jaccard similarity algorithm
|-minhash.py	K-minhash algorithm

2. Set Python environment
Please run the env script (env_bash.sh or env_tcsh.sh) before 
you run the program. Use 'source env_bash.sh' or 'source env_bash.sh'
to run it. It depends on the shell you are using.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
If there is something wrong in my environment, please let me know.
I will fix it soon.

3. How to run
I prepare a Makefile for the grader. If you run 'make',
it will run the program with the whole algs.
It may take a long time on our deparment cluster.

4. How to review
You can use vim or other editors to open the output files.
Each line shows the similarity of one pair of documents.
The running time and MSE will be printed directly on the screen. 

If you have any problems, please let me know.

Project 5
Name: Fang Zhou

1. Structure of the project
Root
|-apriori			apriori algorithm
|-shuffle.py	Shuffle the input file and generate train set and test set
|-feature.py	Use rules to test the accuracy
|-report.pdf	The report for assignment 5
|-Makefile		Makefile

2. Set Python environment
Please run the env script (env_bash.sh or env_tcsh.sh) before 
you run the program. Use 'source env_bash.sh' or 'source env_bash.sh'
to run it. It depends on the shell you are using.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
If there is something wrong in my environment, please let me know.
I will fix it soon.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. How to run
I prepare a Makefile for the grader. If you run 'make',
it will run the program with the whole algs.
It may take a long time on our deparment cluster.

4. How to review
You can redirect the standard output to a file or observe the value
directly in the screen.
You can find the offline cost, online cost, and accuracy for different
data sets, different support values, and different confidence values.

If you have any problems, please let me know.

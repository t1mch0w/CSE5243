2. Set Python environment
Please run the env script (env_bash.sh or env_tcsh.sh) before 
you run the program. Use 'source env_bash.sh' or 'source env_bash.sh'
to run it. It depends on the shell you are using.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
It seems there is something wrong in my environment. I will fix it soon.

3. How to run
I prepare a Makefile for the grader. If you run 'make',
it will run the program with the whole clustering algs.
It may take a long time on our deparment cluster.

4. How to review
You can use vim or other editors to open the output files.
The first line in each output file should contain the attribute 
names. So you can easily know there are how many attributes and
what the meanings of them are.
The other lines show the values of the feature vectors in the unit
of document, which means one line represents one document in this
file.
If you do not want the attribute names, you can use awk, sed and any 
commands you like to remove the first line.

If you have any problems, please let me know.
